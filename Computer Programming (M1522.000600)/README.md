# Computer Programming (M1522.000600)

This repository contains my implementation of problems of the course Computer Programming (M1522.000600) by Professor Young Ki Lee from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, College of Engineering, Seoul National University. In this course, students learn Object-Oriented programming methodologies and skills using Java and C++. Students first learn the fundamentals of Java and C++ programming languages, and then they lean by practice how to design and develop high-quality Object-Oriented software that correctly solves real-world problems in a sound and valid way.
