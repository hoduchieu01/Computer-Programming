# Computer Programming (M1522.000600)
This repository contains my implementation of problems of the course Computer Programming (M1522.000600) by Professor Young Ki Lee from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, College of Engineering, Seoul National University. In this course, students learn Object-Oriented programming methodologies and skills using Java and C++. Students first learn the fundamentals of Java and C++ programming languages, and then they lean by practice how to design and develop high-quality Object-Oriented software that correctly solves real-world problems in a sound and valid way.


| Homework        | Problems         | Descriptions
| -----------     | -----------      | -----------
| Homework 1      | 10       | 10 simple problems to take the first step with Java programming language
| Homework 2      | 2        | Develop a secure mobile banking service that supports financial transactions like deposit, withdrawal, and transfer with secure transactions and develop a simple free-market economy and demonstrate the equilibrium state
| Homework 3      | 2        | Implementing features for Movie Application (Searching, Rating, Recommendation) and SNS (Authenticate, Post a User Article, Recommend Friend's Posts, Search Posts)
| Homework 4      | 2        | Develop an auto-grading system and develop a course registration system with various features: searching course information, placing a bid, confirming bids
| Homework 5      | 2        | Problem set 1 covers simple C++ basic exercises consists of palindrome string, hamming distance, merge arrays, pascal's triangle, and school cafeteria, while we need to implement Wi-Fi Signal Decoder in problem set 2 with various features consisting of printing complex values, reading and organizing CSI values, decoding CSI values, extracting useful information from CSI, and estimating breathing interval
| Homework 6      | 2        | In this problem set, we need to implement a Shopping Application with Interface for Admins, an Interface for Users, and Product Recommendations. On the other hand, we need to implement SNS Applications in C++
