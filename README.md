# Computer Programming

### Computer Programming (M1522.000600)
This repository contains my implementation of problems of the course Computer Programming (M1522.000600) by Professor Young Ki Lee from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, College of Engineering, Seoul National University. In this course, students learn Object-Oriented programming methodologies and skills using Java and C++. Students first learn the fundamentals of Java and C++ programming languages, and then they learn by practice how to design and develop high-quality Object-Oriented software that correctly solves real-world problems in a sound and valid way.


| Homework          | Problems         | Descriptions
| -----------       | -----------      | -----------
| Homework 1        | 10               | 10 simple problems to take the first step with Java programming language.
| Homework 2        | 2                | In problem 1, we need to develop a secure mobile banking service that supports financial transactions like deposit, withdrawal, and transfer with secure transactions. In problem 2, we need to develop a simple free-market economy and demonstrate the equilibrium state.
| Homework 3        | 2                | In problem 1, we need to implement features for Movie Applications including Searching, Rating, and Recommendation. In problem 2, we need to implement SNS consisting of Authenticate, Post a User Article, Recommend Friend's Posts, and Search Posts.
| Homework 4        | 2                | In problem 1, we need to develop an auto-grading system that compiles, executes, and grades students' submissions. In problem 2, we need to develop a course registration system with various features: searching course information, placing a bid, confirming bids
| Homework 5        | 2                | Problem 1 covers simple C++ basic exercises consisting of palindrome string, hamming distance, merge arrays, pascal's triangle, and school cafeteria, while we need to implement Wi-Fi Signal Decoder in problem 2 with various features consisting of printing complex values, reading and organizing CSI values, decoding CSI values, extracting useful information from CSI, and estimating breathing interval
| Homework 6        | 2                | In this problem 1, we need to implement a Shopping Application with Interface for Admins, an Interface for Users, and Product Recommendations. On the other hand, in problem 2, we need to implement SNS Applications in C++.
